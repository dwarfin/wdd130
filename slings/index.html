                <h2>Why</h2>
                <p>
                    Slings offer a variety of benefits to the user. Not only do 
                    they hold the rifle for you but can give you better mobility 
                    and accuracy. If you are outside carrying a rifle for an extended 
                    period of time it can get tiring fast. With a sling the weight
                     of the rifle is transferred from your arms to your shoulders. 
                     Not only does this transfer the weight but now both of your hands 
                     are available. When shooting the rifle, you can utilize different 
                     positions as well as the sling to provide a brace which can help 
                     increase accuracy. Rifle slings provide a way to quickly put your 
                     rifle out of the way and when needed quickly grab it again.

                <h2>What</h2>
                <p>
                    Do you want a more comfortable way to carry a rifle? Do you 
                    want better stabilization when shooting? Do you want the ability 
                    to utilize both hands, yet keep your rifle out of the way but still 
                    within armâ€™s reach? My idea is to make fully customizable rifle slings 
                    that can fit any body frame. Rifle slings made from nylon strap and paracord. 
                    With this website I will be able to help show others what I am making and 
                    potentially even sell them. The intended audience of this website is people 
                    who are looking for a customizable rifle sling or want to know more about slings. 
                    They are looking for something that they will find functional, useful, as well 
                    as comfortable. The audience is most likely going to be people who are interested 
                     in outdoor shooting activities. People can access this website through a desktop, laptop, or mobile device.

                <h2>How</h2>
                <p>
                    These rifle slings are made from paracord and nylon webbing. 
                    First you choose weave. Different weaves have different amounts of paracord.
                    Some weaves use one, two, or three different colors or strands of paracord.  Different weaves offer overall 
                    different looks to the rifle sling. With the nylon webbing 
                    you can also choose any color you want. The nylon webbing also provides a way to make 
                    the sling adjustable to meet any size that is desired.

                    This sling featues a Covenant Oath weave which takes three different
                    strands of paracord. The three colors chosen for this specific sling 
                    are burgundy and blue camo running down the outside with black running 
                    down the center and a vibrant pink nylon strap.
