        Slings offer a variety of benefits to the user. Not only do they hold the rifle for you but can give you better mobility and accuracy. If you are outside carrying a rifle for an extended period of time it can get tiring fast. With a sling the weight of the rifle is transferred from your arms to your shoulders. Not only does this transfer the weight but now both of your hands are available. When shooting the rifle, you can utilize different positions as well as the sling to provide a brace which can help increase accuracy. Rifle slings provide a way to quickly put your rifle out of the way and when needed quickly grab it again.

        These rifle slings are made from paracord and nylon webbing. The paracord alone offers a variety of customizable elements to the sling. With the paracord you can choose one, two, or three different colors. Along with the different colors you can also choose different weaves. Different weaves offer overall different looks to the rifle sling, and it does not stop there. With the nylon webbing you can also choose any color you want. The nylon webbing also provides a way to make the sling adjustable to meet any size that is desired. The sling is incredibly strong as it is composed of paracord and nylon webbing which on their own are durable and strong. For some reason if you ever find yourself in need of upwards of 70 feet of paracord and 3 feet or nylon webbing, you are in luck.

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        When it comes to designing a sling there are very little limitation. If the paracord and nylon webbing exists in the color you wish and there is a paracord weave for it, then it can be made. There are hundreds of paracord weaves to choose from so finding one that you like should not be a challenge. If anything, the challenge is deciding your favorite weave from all the weaves you like. From the covenant oath, to double wide soloman, to the king cobra, to the wide genoese, you definitely have a variety to choose from.
